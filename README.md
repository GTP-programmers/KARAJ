## A command-line software to streamline acquiring biological data

We here developed KARAJ a fast and flexible command-line software for Linux that automate querying and streamline downloading of a wide range of file formats containing biological data. KARAJ has five main advantages over other similar tools; firstly, it gives a summary list of accessible datasets generated by or used in scientific articles and enables users to select whichever ones are willing to download; secondly, KARAJ calculates the size of files users willing to download and checks with the local driver to ensure the availability of adequate space in the local disk; thirdly, KARAJ generates the metadata table containing sample information and experimental design of the corresponding study; fourthly, this user-friendly pipeline automatically checks and installs all of the requirements, and lastly, it enables users to download supplementary data tables  attached to publications. We described the options of KARAJ and evaluated its performance by analyzing the data sets from three research papers. KARAJ and the instructions for local installation are publicly available at https://rdrr.io/github/mahdieh1/XXX.

## Common Error messages

| Error message | Description |
| :--- | :--- | 
| Invalid option, please see the Help using -h option | The error message states that you cannot use the KARAJ command with the determined flags. |
|Argument missing from ID option|The error message states that you miss value after the argument ID.|
|You missed one of the obligatory arguments|The error message states that all of the flags ( -p, -l, -f, -i) are empty. You need to run KARAJ command with one of these obligatory flags.|
|You enter two obligatory flags with each other. Please enter one of these flags.|The error message states that you enter arguments of (-p, -l, -f) with each other. Karaj fetch and download one types of file in each run. |
|No sample found. Either the provided ID is invalid or raw data was not provided for this record. | The error message states that raw data is not accessible with the one of IDs ( -p, -l, -f, -i) you enter. |
| Directory does not have enough space for all files you aim to download. Please change the directory. |The error message states that there is no space in the working directory to download data.|
